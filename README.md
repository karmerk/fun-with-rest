Lets have fun building a REST API


I talked with a colleague about Web APIs and whether these conform to REST... My experience most APIs are not REST, but often some weird hybrid of semi-REST and some request/response design.

I perfer to drop REST and go for a 100% request/response design in my APIs, but nevertheless - Lets have fun with REST.
